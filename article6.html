                    <h6><b>Introduction</b></h6>
                    <p>Upon the coming into effect of the Third Alteration Act, 2010, the National Industrial Court (NIC) was enlisted as a court of record and unlike other Courts in its class, it arrogate to itself the Status of the Alpha and Omega in its civil jurisdiction except on matters contained in Chapter 4 of the Constitution (Third Alteration) Act, 2010.  This development became one of the most difficult conundrums among the legal minds and generated conflicting interpretations and confusions. </p>
                    <p>On the 30th June, 2017, the Apex Court resolved this riddle in it decision in a case stated  from the Court of Appeal Lagos Division in SC/885/14, Skye Bank Plc V. IWU when it held that there is no Constitutional provision divesting the Court of Appeal of its jurisdiction to hear appeals emanating from the National Industrial Court and all decisions of the National Industrial Court (NIC) are appealable to the Court of Appeal as of right in Criminal Matter and fundamental rights cases and with the leave of the Court of Appeal in all other civil matters being handled by NIC.</p>
                    <p>This decision was applauded and celebrated by the Bar and perhaps the Bench who may have seen the National Industrial Court to be more powerful than it equals by arrogating to itself the status of Apex Court whose decisions in its civil jurisdiction cannot be reviewed.  Notwithstanding, the wild outburst of applause of the Judgment, some are of the view that the decision was arrived per incuria and describe the decision as an arrogation of legislative functions to the Judiciary.</p>
                    <p>This write up will look at the History of the NIC, conundrums posed by the third alteration to the Constitution, extract of the Supreme Court (SC) judgment and reasoning behind their decision and the writer opinion on the decision of the SC.</p>
                    <p><b>History of the Court:</b></p>
                    <p>The National Industrial Court was first established  by virtue of the Trade Disputes Act No. 7 of 1976 to provide an avenue or forum for a smooth and flexible industrial dispute resolution regime which objective could not be met by the regular Courts. The Court started its adjudication functions in 1978 and its object was to provide for a stable and sustainable economy through quick, effective and efficient resolution of industrial disputes and protection of workers. ‘The Court was not popular and its decisions and pronouncements hardly respected , perhaps because most of the presiding judges were not Legal Practitioners.  There was nothing on record to show how superior the Court was. This made the founding judges lobbied to have an enactment ascribing to it the status of a Superior Court of records hence the passing of the National Industrial Court Act, 2006 (The NIC Act).  The NIC Act widen the NIC jurisdiction and ascribe to it: status of Superior Court of record with all the powers of a High Court with the same qualifications of Judges, earning the same salaries and precedence with other judges in the High Court in order of seniority; and exclusive jurisdiction on labour, trade dispute and other ancillary matters that may arise out of same. However, besides having all the power of the High Court, the NIC Act elevated NIC above its counterpart in the High Court such that the NIC judges have a very wide discretionary powers to depart from the provision of the Evidence Act  ‘in the interest of justice’ and above all, subject to the constitutional provision, <b>no appeal shall lie from the decisions of the NIC to the Court of Appeal or any other Court except on Appeal that bothers on question of Fundamental right.</b> The restricted right to appeal the decision of the NIC didn’t go down well with Litigious lawyers and would rather pursue their claim in the High Court on the argument that the Constitution has not taken away the unlimited power of the High Court to hear and determine any civil and criminal actions subject to cause of action under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal High Court.   The Height of this clamp down on the NIC was expressed by the Supreme Court in the case of N.U.E.E V. B.PE  decided on Thursday, 24th February, 2010 that the jurisdiction of the State High Court as conferred by the Constitution can only be curtailed or abridged or eroded by the Constitution itself and not by an Act or Law of the National Assembly or State Assembly respectively. The Decree (Act) arrogating to the NIC a superior Court of record, does not by that token make the NIC a superior Court of record without an amendment of the provisions of Section 6(3) and (5) of the 1999 Constitution which has listed the only superior court and the list does not include the National Industrial Court; until the Constitution is amended it remains a subordinate Court to the High Court.’ </p>
                    <p>Finally the yearnings and aspirations of the ‘promoters’ of the NIC was met in the same 2010, the Constitution was amended to enlist the Court as a Superior Court of Records. In addition to enlisting the NIC in Section 6 as recommended by the SC in N.U.E.E V. B.PE, the Constitution, Section 243 (2), (3), and (4), 254A, B, C,D and 254E were inserted. By the Third Alteration of the Constitution, the Court was granted exclusive jurisdiction on labour, trade dispute and other ancillary matters that may arise out of same which hitherto had been within the confines of the concurrent jurisdiction of the State High Courts and Federal High Court at first instance, NIC was granted all the powers of a High Court and may be granted additional powers as may be necessary and desirable to be more effective in exercising its jurisdiction. </p>
                    <p><b>Conundrums posed by the third alteration to the Constitution:</b></p>
                    <p>Section 240  of the Constitution(Third Alteration) Act, 2010 provides that: </p>
                    <p>“subject to the provision of this Constitution, the Court of Appeal shall have jurisdiction to the exclusion of any other Court of law in Nigeria, to hear and determine appeals from the Federal High Court, the National Industrial Court, the High Court of a State,… and from decisions of a court martial or other tribunals <i>as may be prescribed by an Act of the National Assembly.”</i> Italics mine for emphasis.</p>
                    <p>Section 241 and 242 provides situation where appeal will lie from the Federal High Court or High Court to the Court of Appeal as or right or with leave.  Section 243 (1) went further to describe the manner of exercising the right of appeal from the Federal High Court or High Court while subsection (2), (3) and (4) only referred to how appeal can lie as of right and leave from the National Industrial Court. </p>
                    <p>These subsections are explicit that appeal can only lie as of right from NIC on matters on question of Fundamental human right and criminal matters  while in other civil matters it is stated that </p>
                    <p id="indent">“An appeal shall only lie from the decisions of the National Industrial Court to the Court of Appeal <i>as may be prescribed by an Act of the National Assembly;</i> provided that where an Act or Law prescribes that an appeal shall lie from the decisions of the National Industrial Court to the Court of Appeal, such appeal shall be with the leave of Court of Appeal …. The decision of the Court of Appeal in respect of any appeal arising from any civil jurisdiction of the National Industrial Court shall be final.”</p>
                    <p>The Third Alteration Act is a deliberate and radical break from the Legal Norms on Hierarchy of Court.  The Provision of Section 243 (2) to (3) generated a lot of controversies and even conflicting decision of the Court of Appeal. Before the Decision on the SC in Sky Bank vs. Iwu on 30th June, 2017, there were two schools of thought on the right of appeals from decisions of the National Industrial Court to Court of Appeal vide Section 243(2) & (3) of the Constitution of Nigeria 1999 (as amended). These schools of thought were sharply divided. To the first school of thought only appeal on ground alleging of breach of the provisions of Chapter IV of the Constitution of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) lies as of right to the Court of Appeal from the decision of the National Industrial Court.  To the second school of thought, while appeal on ground alleging breach of Chapter IV of the Constitution of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) lies as of right from the decision of the National Industrial Court to the Court of Appeal, all other appeals alleging ground other than breach of Chapter IV of the Constitution of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) lie with the leave of Court. In other words, all decisions of the National Industrial Court are subject to appeal to the Court of Appeal, either as of right or with leave in that the National Industrial Court is not a Court of Final Jurisdiction under the Constitution of Nigeria 1999 (as amended).</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding, the view of the 1st school of thought, the Bench and Lawyers condemns the Act which striped off aggrieved party’s right to appeal the decision of the trial Court. In COCA-COLA (NIG) LTD VS AKINSANYA , Justice Lokulo –Sodipo JCA commented that it is clear from the provisions of Section 243 (2), (3) and (4), the NIC though a superior court of record is not in the same league with the Federal and State High Courts. By virtue of Section 243 (2) to (4) the NIC is the only superior court of record created by the Constitution that can entertain civil and criminal jurisdictions and whose decisions in respect of its civil jurisdiction are appealable to the Court of Appeal on ground of violation of fundamental rights provision only, and whose decision(s) can never get to the Supreme Court for review. He said the NIC jurisdiction is extensive and diverse as to the extent that its name “National Industrial Court” would clearly appear not to be properly describe the “multi-nature” superior court of records.  In the Same case, Ikyegh JCA also expressed that the Constitution that made the NIC a superior court of record broke from its tradition of conferring appellate jurisdiction on the court of Appeal over the other decision of the NIC as it has done in respect of the other superior courts created by it, by stating that an appeal shall only lie from other decisions (except on questions of fundamental rights) of the NIC to the court of Appeal as may be prescribed by an Act of the National Assembly. He further said, that, as the position stands now, there is no enactment of the National Assembly conferring a right of Appeal from any decision of the NIC.  The duty of judges is to interpret and not to make the law as well as to give natural meaning of the statute where the words are clear and unambiguous. </p>
                    <p>Even though the Court of Appeal in Coca-cola’s case unanimously held that the decision of the NIC cannot be appealed except as provided for by section 243(2),(3) and (4), one could tell from the obiter that they were constraint by the laid down principle to interpret the law as it is and not as it ought to be. </p>
                    <p>The argument of the first school of thought which has been overtaken by the Supreme Court Decision are:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The wordings  of the statute are clear and unambiguous consequently, the literal interpretation should be given to it.</li>
                        <li>That only matter on fundamental right and criminal matter can be appeal as of right to the Court of appeal.</li>
                        <li>Appeal can only lie as <i>may be prescribed by an Act of the National Assembly</i> Where an Act or Law prescribe that Appeal may lie such appeal shall be with the Leave of Court of Appeal.
                            </li>
                        <li>Decision of the Court of Appeal in respect of any appeal arising from any civil jurisdiction of the National Industrial Court shall be final.</li>
                        <li>The right of appeal with leave is contingent on the futuristic exercise of the powers of the National Assembly and there is no Act or Law prescribing how appeal may lie from NIC to the Court of appeal.</li>
                    </ol>                   
                <p><b>The extract of the Supreme Court Judgment and the Reasoning behind the Decision:</b></p>
                <p>On 11th November, 2014, the Court of Appeal, Lagos Division in Sky Bank vs Iwu granted an application that a case be stated before the Supreme Court, for its opinion on the Constitutional issue as regards the scope of the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal in appeals emanating from the National Industrial Court. Being a constitutional issue that had generated conflicting decisions of various Divisions of the Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court was entreated to offer its opinion on the Court of Appeal triadic formulations which were summarized by the SC thus: </p>
                <p id="indent"><b>“Whether the Court of Appeal as an appellate court created by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) has the jurisdiction to the exclusion of any other court of law in Nigeria to hear and determine all appeals arising from the decisions of the National Industrial Court of Nigeria?</b></p>
                <p>The Supreme Court’s answers to the questions posed to it in the case statement are: </p> 
                <ol>
                    <li>the Court of Appeal has the jurisdiction, to the exclusion of any other court in Nigeria, to hear and determine all appeals arising from the decisions of the trial court, that is, the National Industrial Court; </li>
                    <li>no constitutional provisions, expressly, divested the said Court of Appeal of its appellate jurisdiction over all decisions on civil matters emanating from the trial court, the National Industrial Court and </li>
                    <li>as a corollary, the jurisdiction of the Court to hear and determine civil appeals from the decisions of the National Industrial Court is not limited, only, to fundamental rights matters.</li>

                </ol>
                <p>The Supreme Court breaks the resolution of the issue formulated into sub question thus: elucidation on the established principles for the interpretation of constitutional provision; a reconstruction of the architecture of the hierarchy of courts prior to the Third Alteration; how the SC's decision in N. U. E, £ and Anor v BPE (2010) LPELR -62. 62/2004 prompted the Third Alteration to pitch-fork NIC into the architectural framework of the judicature; disambiguation of the intention of the draftsperson in enacting the new provisions in the Third Alteration to certain canons of interpretation; decodation of the said intention of the draftsperson in relation to the provisions on the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal, Sections 240; the exercise of the right of appeal, Section 243 (1) (a) and (b); (2)- (3); and The question whether all decisions of the trial court are appealable particular on whether the exercise of rights of appeal with leave of the lower court is contingent on the enactment of an Act of the National Assembly to that effect. Their resolutions on the sub-questions are intertwined and have been sum up.</p>
                <p><b>1.  THE INTERPRETATION OF THE CONSTITUTION,</b></p>
                <p>The Supreme Court restated the rules of interpretation both from local and commonwealth decision thus:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>In interpreting the Constitution mere technical rules of interpretation of statutes are, to some extent, inadmissible in a way so as to defeat the principles of government enshrined, where the question is whether the Constitution "has used an expression in the wider or in the narrower sense... the court should, whenever possible, and <u>in response to the demands of justice,</u> <i>lean to the broader interpretation,</i> unless there is something in the in text or in the rest of the Constitution to indicate that the narrower interpretation will best carry out the objects and purpose of the <i>Constitution.</i> </li>
                    <li>All sections are to be construed together and, hence, it is impermissible to construe sections in isolation text or in the rest of the Constitution to indicate that the narrower interpretation will best carry out the objects and purpose of the <i>Constitution</i></li>
                    <li>Where the words are clear and unambiguous, a literal interpretation will be applied, that is, they will be accorded their plain and grammatical meaning</li>
                    <li>However, where there is inherent ambiguity in any section, a holistic interpretation would be resorted to in order to arrive at the intention of its framers</li>
                    <li>Since the draftsperson is not known to extravagate words or provisions, it is anathematic to construe a section in such a manner as to render other sections redundant or superfluous </li>
                    <li>As a follow-up to the rule against "ambiguity," if the words of a statute are ambiguous, then the Law Maker's intention must be sought, first, in the statute itself, then in other legislation and <u>contemporary circumstances</u> and by resort to the mischief rule.</li>
                    <li>In all, the proper approach to the construction of the Constitution "should be...one of liberalism; a variation on the theme of the general maxim <i>ut res magis valeat quarri pereat </i> As such, it would be improper to construe any of the provisions of the Constitution as to defeat the obvious ends the Constitution was designed to serve where another construction, equally, in accord and consistent with the words and sense of such provisions will serve to enforce and protect such ends,                </li>
                </ol>
                <p>The SC said that above all, the rationale of all binding authorities is that a narrow interpretation that would do violence to its provisions and fail to achieve the goal set by the Constitution must be avoided. Thus, where alternative constructions are equally open, the construction that is consistent with the smooth working of the system, which the Constitution, read as a whole, has set out to regulate, is to be preferred,  </p>
                <p>The principle that underlies this construction technique is that the Legislature would legislate only for the purpose of bringing about an effective result</p>
                <p>SC, therefore accordingly endorsed the position that the construction of any document is a holistic endeavor.</p>
                <p><b>2.  A RECONSTRUCTION OF THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE HIERARCHY OF COURTS PRIOR TO THE THIRD ALTERATION:</b></p>
                <p>The Court held that The Third Alteration was, inter alia, prompted by the need to elevate NIC to the prestigious category of superior courts within the architecture of the judicial hierarchy of Courts under the Constitution. In distilling the intention of the draftsperson, SC referred to the phraseology of the Long Title of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (Third Alteration) Act, [Act No 3), 2010 couched thus "An Act to alter the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria Cap. 23, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004, for the establishment of the National. Industrial Court under the Constitution"  the Court buttressed its decision by further reference to Section 254”d” which confers the trial Court with "all the powers of a High Court", Section 243 by inserting, NIC immediately, after the words 'Federal High Court in the marginal note. SC further said that the draftsperson is not known to extravagate words or provisions of an enactment, it would be anathematic to construe section 243 (2) -(3) in such a manner as to render section 240 superfluous or redundant.</p>
                <p>SC concluded on the reconstruction of the architecture of the hierarchy of courts that a harmonious rendition of the general purpose of Sections 6 (3) and 5 (a), (b), (c), (cc), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h) and (i) (supra) with section 240; and section 254(d) (1) is that the Third Alteration succeeded in vesting the trial court with a superior status just like the High Courts which were, hitherto, under the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal and as such, the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction over it just like the High Court. The only difference is that, unlike the Federal High Court and the other categories of High Courts, NIC decisions are, deliberately, made appealable only to the Court of Appeal.</p>
                <p>SC said the insertion of section 243 (4) is the most thoughtful insertion made by the draftsperson which achieved two things, firstly, insulating the SC from armada of appeals it would have and secondly spares the litigants before NIC the forensic drudgery and weariness associated with agitating matters from trial courts to the apex court, often spanning decades. </p>
                <p><b>3.  SECTIONS 240; 243 (2) - (3): LITERAL INTERPRETATION AND AMBIGUITY OF LEGISLATIVE INTENTION</b></p>
                <p>That the purposive interpretation which is consistent with the long title, is that Sections 243 (2) - (3) cannot, by any stretch of interpretive logic, supplant Sections 240 and 243 (4).</p>
                <p>It was held that the legislature could not have intended that section 243 (2) - (3) could, validly, curtail or circumscribe the right, expressly, consecrated by section 240 and 243 (4) for to do so would mean that its intendment was to render the latter provisions redundant and ineffectual: a state of affairs which is anathematic in Anglo-Nigerian jurisprudence,</p>
                <p>In effect, Sections 243 (2) and (3) cannot, validly, strip litigants of the rights, expressly, conferred on them by Sections 240 and 243 (4) without an express provision to wreak that kind of, unjustifiable, denudation of the latter right, that is, the right in Section 240 and 243 (4).</p>
                <p><b>4.  SECTIONS 240 AND 243 (2) - (3): SECTION 243 (1) GUIDE TO THE INTENTION ON THE APPEAL PROVISIONS</b></p>
                <p>The SC took the view that:</p>

                    <li>since the Constitution has conceded rights of appeal to litigants in one section, the draftsperson could not have been minded to strip them of such rights in another section of the Constitution.</li>
                    <li>When the Draftsperson of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) speaks of 'person having interest' in the second clause of Section 243 (1) (a) using the phrase synonymously with the phrase a 'person aggrieved, hence the draftsperson couldnot have intended that the same indulgence would not avail a named party, that is, a party to the action and interpreting the intention otherwise would be equivalent of the logical fallacy of reductio ad absurdunr which cannot be because the draftsperson has never been a protagonist of absurd or contradictory results.</li>
                    <li>Above all, the SC in adopting the mischief rule of interpretation, took the view that the draftsperson intended to pluck the trial court from the juridical nadir of inferiority to the superior status ranking in judicial hierarchy with the High Courts. The draftsperson did not, therefore, intend that the said court, upon its elevation, would navigate out of the Court of Appeal circumambient appellate constitutional jurisdiction over all the courts, now, consecrated in Section 240 and hold otherwise would wreak havoc on the settled notion of hierarchy of courts under the Constitution.</li>

                <p><b>5.  FUTURISTIC LEGISLATIVE ACTION BY THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY</b></p>
                <p>On the argument of making the right of appeal with leave contingent on the futuristic exercise of the powers of the National Assembly. Nweze JSC took the  view that, "in the exercise of the right of appeal against the decisions of the trial court, which Section 240 bequeaths to him and, with respect to section 243 (4), "any appeal from any civil jurisdiction!', all a prospective appellant needs to do is to rely on Section 24 (1) of the Court of Appeal Act, an extant enactment of the National Assembly; an existing Act of the National Assembly and on Order 7 Rules 5 and 10 (1) of the Court of Appeal Rules, 2011, a subsidiary legislation, whose potency traces its pedigree to the Constitutive Act.</p>
                <p>These two enactments have, already, set out the procedure of appeals either as of right or with the lower court's leave.  In effect, within the framework of the extant enactment, namely, section 24 (1) of the Court of Appeal Act (supra) and Order 7 Rules 5 and 10 (1) of the Court of Appeal Rules, an aggrieved litigant can exercise the right of appeal against, inter alia, the trial court, the National Industrial Court.</p>
                <p>The summary of the judgment is that the statute should be interpreted holistically such as to fulfill the purpose of the Constitution, the Law maker does not make law to make other provision of the Statute redundant and superfluous and should not be interpreted as such. </p>
                <p>Writer’s Opinion:   Whether the Basis of the Judgment was correct:</p>
                <p>There has been plethora of cases by the SC that the role of the Court is to interpret law as it is and not to make law. This writer initially, share the view of some that “the SC by this judgment arrogate to itself the function of the Legislature” however, having read the whole judgment and based on the proper approach to the construction of the Constitution which was stated to be ‘one of liberalism; a variation on the theme of the general maxim ut res magis valeat quarri pereat  as such, it would be improper to construe any of the provisions of the Constitution as to defeat the obvious ends the Constitution was designed to serve where another construction, equally, in accord and consistent with the words and sense of such provisions will serve to enforce and protect such ends,  . (underline mine for emphasis) This approach expressed with the maxim ut res magis valeat quarri pereat in my view, forms the basis of the SC decision rather than the mischief rules. </p>
                <p>As Litigation lawyer, this writer agreed with the Honorable Justice Babatunde Adejumo that “If labour matters are allowed to be so over-prolonged, the economy will collapse” and there will be a lot of injustice which is not the essence of the Court. Most of the Labor matters revolves around, wrongful termination; dismissal; employee compensation for industrial accident, union dispute in which the remedy is not always substantial payment of terminal benefits, compensation, interpretation of collective bargaining agreements, damages, injunction etc. if all matters are allowed to go on appeal at the end of the day, it would have been better not to have even seek remedy in Court as the reward will not be commensurate with effort, resources and time invested in the matter.  There is always power imbalance in labour matters wherein the employers are more powerful than the employees.  The Employer can afford to pay legal service upto the Supreme Court while the employee who probably is out of job may not be able to afford it, hence the justice will be for the rich and ceased to be the hope of common man. The provision would also help to reduce the workload of the Court of Appeal. </p>
                <p>It is our view that the intention of the lawmaker is to make the National Industrial Court powerful and even more powerful than the Federal and High Court.  Section 254D(1) and (2) is very apposite when it state that  “ for the purpose of exercising any jurisdiction conferred upon it, the National Industrial Court shall have all the powers of a High Court.  (2) notwithstanding subsection (1) of this section the National Assembly may by law, make provisions conferring upon the National Industrial Court powers additional to those conferred by this section as may appear necessary or desirable for enabling the Court to be more effective in exercising its jurisdiction.  This power confer upon the Court includes the power to restrict hearing of Appeal from of the National Industrial Court as also contained in the NIC Act. The exclusion of the National Industrial Court from section 241, 242, 243(1), Section 9 of the Constitution (Third Alteration) Act, The NIC Act, and the history of the Court are pointer that the Lawmaker intended the literal interpretation of Section 243( 2) and (3).</p>
                <p>By the SC holding that “… the most thoughtful insertion of section 243 (4) (supra), the draftsperson achieved two things…” to my mind is an admission that the questions posed to the Supreme Court were interpreted liberally and as it ought to be not as it is.</p>
                <p>The intention identified by the SC for the insertion of the S. 243(3) namely: insulating the SC from armada of appeals it would have and secondly spares the litigants before NIC the forensic drudgery and weariness associated with agitating matters from trial courts to the apex court, often spanning decades with all due respect to the SC, in addition to listing the NIC as Superior Court are the real intention of the draft-person and or the sponsor of the bill.</p>
                <p>However, would interpreting the provision as such serve the purpose of the Constitution, would it bring about justice, I think not.  As pointed out by the Court, Sub section 1 of Section 243 allows an interested party to come in to the matter with leave and appeal against the decision of the Federal or High Court (which are of coordinate jurisdiction with the NIC), why would he have deny the parties to the matter right to review their cases.</p>
                <p>The disadvantages of interpreting the Section 243 (2) and (3) as it outweighs the advantages. It is the function of the Court to do justice in all the matters brought before it and in this instant we believe the interpretation given by the Supreme Court is in line with purpose of the Constitution and the basis for its judgment is legally correct as it would be improper to construe any of the provisions of the Constitution as to defeat the obvious ends the Constitution was designed to serve, i.e justice and alter the structure of hierarchy of Court, thereby arrogating the NIC the status of Supreme Court.</p>
                <p>The Supreme Court is the final authority, not because its infallible, but to put an end to litigation.  Like a popular adage says, two goods heads are better than one.  The Court of Appeal is the Number two Court as designed by the Constitution and its dully constituted if it consists of at least three judge and their decisions are still subjected to the Supreme Court for review except in Election Petition (note that election tribunal also sit in panel of three not just one judge) while the National Industrial Court in its mightiness is dully constituted if it consist of a single judge and not more than three judge.  In truth, the power given to the NIC is too much and should be curtailed.  </p>
                <p>Though it may be argued that the proper way should have been having another Act of the National Assembly balancing the provision as right of appeal is granted by statute not by statutory interpretation by the court.  With the bunch of legislators we have now, it is unlikely that any of such, legislation will be passed soon. Leaving the NIC as the final or Supreme Court will not augur well for the aggrieved litigants, especially as anything to do with employment affects the livelihood of members of the workforce and, invariably, their dependants.  Also preventing aggrieved litigant from appealing may breed judicial laxity and to some extent corruption in the Justice Delivery system as absolute power corrupt absolutely.</p>
                <p>If the NIC is left without any hint of appellate oversight/surveillance may lead to the result that anything goes.</p>
                <p>A contrary interpretation by the SC, would not only wreak havoc to the settled notion of hierarchy of courts under the Constitution, it would also eventuate to a hermeneutic quagmire -a quagmire which is capable of muddling up the settled hierarchy in the appellate process.</p>
                <p>A contrary interpretation would violate the cardinal principle in Anglo-Nigerian jurisprudence, namely, the right to resort to a higher court to review the decision of a lower court with a view to determining whether on the facts placed before it, and applying the relevant and applicable law, the lower Court came to a right or wrong decision.</p>
                <p>On another note, a community reading of the proviso to Section 243 (3) Section 240 and Section 24 of the Court of Appeal Act, could be construed to have taken away all inhibition to appealing the decision of the NIC and the Court of Appeal Act is an Act of the National Assembly and had prescribed how Appeal may be made to the Court of Any. There is nothing futuristic in the clause “ as may be prescribed by an Act of the National Assembly” Section 24 of Court of Appeal is a prescription of the National Assembly and thus suffice.</p>
                <p><b>Conclusion and Recommendation:</b></p>
                <p>Accordingly, where the question is whether the Constitution "has used an expression in the wider or in the narrower sense... the court should, whenever possible, and in response to the demands of justice, lean to the broader interpretation, unless there is something in the text or in the rest of the Constitution to indicate that the narrower interpretation will best carry out the objects and purpose of the Constitution”.  The object and purpose of the Nigerian Constitution is to promote the good government and welfare of all persons in our country (Nigeria) on the principles of freedom, equality and justice.   The interpretation of  Section 240, 243 (2),(3) and (4) given by the SC is in response to the demand of justice and in accordance with the purpose of the constitution and consequently, set a good precedence on interpretation, legally supported and justifiable.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding our conclusion, The National Assembly should amend Section 243 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (Third Alteration) to spell out in very clear terms that the decisions of the National Industrial Court can be appealed against without any inhibition.</p>
                <p>Before passing any bill, the stakeholders should be involved and the public has the duty to read and evaluate the Bill to prevent any absurdity.  I believe if NBA has been dutiful, it would have participated in the Review and the 3rd alteration to the Constitution and may be able to have forestalled this kind of situation.</p>
