                    <h6>WHY YOU SHOULD NOT IGNORE SERVICE OF COURT DOCUMENT</h6>
                    <P>
                        It is common in this part of the World to refuse to collect Court processes also known as referred to as Court's documents, thinking that nothing can happen in as much as it is not collected or acknowledged. However, in actual sense, failure to know the content of what is served on you may cost you more than you could imagine.
                    </P>

                    <h6>1. IMPORTANCE OF PROPER SERVICE OF COURT DOCUMENTS </h6>
                    <p>It is trite that proper service of a process is an essential aspect of Nigerian procedural law. It gives the party served the opportunity of being heard, and it is a condition precedent to the competence of the court assuming jurisdiction and adjudicating over the legal rights of litigants. Service of process is therefore a jurisdictional issue. Accordingly, any matter or proceedings affected by lapse in service of process suffers a fundamental flaw - Agip (Nig) Ltd V. Agip Petroli International (2010) 5 NWLR (pt 1187) 348, Multichem Industries Ltd V. Musa (2013) 8 NWLR (Pt 1356) 404.</p>

                    <h6>2. EFFECT OF NON SERVICE</h6>
                    <p>
                        Failure to serve a process where the process is required to be served renders any Order made against the party not served with the process null and void - See the case of First Bank of Nigeria Plc V. TSA Industries Ltd (2010) 15 NWLR (pt 1216) 247." Per ABIRU,J.C.A. (P.22,paras.C-G)
                    </p>
                    <h6>  3. SUBSTITUTED SERVICE </h6>
                    <p> The basic position of the law is that a party in litigation should be served with the originating process of Court personally. In view of the fact that personal service may not be possible or feasible all the time, for instance where the party is evading service or his/her whereabout is unknown, the law recognizes service by substitution. Various Court rules identified and provide for other means of serving the processes where it is made to appear to the Court that personal service cannot be effected, the Court may make such order for substituted service as deem necessary. </p>

                    <h6>4. HOW APPLICATION FOR SUBSTITUTED SERVICE IS MADE </h6>

                    <p>Every application to the Court for substituted service is to be supported by an affidavit setting forth the grounds upon which the application is made. The law expects the applicant to set out in an affidavit the reason or reasons why the service by substitution is necessary. Where the Court is satisfied with the reason or reasons deposed in an affidavit, an application for substituted service will be granted. The court may order service by pasting on the entrance gate at the last known address of the defendant; it may order service in the national newspaper, social media, electronic mail, on any relations or in such other manner as the Court may deem necessary to make in the circumstance of the case.</p>

                    <h6> 5. SERVICE ON CORPORATE ENTITY</h6>
                    <p>
                        For corporate entity, the combined meaning or effect of Section 78 of Companies and Allied Matters Act, Rules of Court and plethora of cases by the appellate Courts, a process is served properly on a company by: (a) Giving the writ or document to any Director, Secretary or other principal officer of the entity (b) By leaving the document at the office of the corporation or company and such service would be deemed to be properly done.
                    </p>
                    <h6>6. CONSEQUENCE OF EVADING, IGNORING SERVICE OF THE COURT'S DOCUMENTS</h6>
                    <p>Below are some of the consequences of evading, ignoring services or where it is impossible to locate the defendant:</p>
                    <p>
                        a.   the documents may be pasted on the defendant's gate and every passerby would know the Court case against him/her which may be embarrassing.
                    </br>b. the documents may be published in the newspaper, and or social media and everyone would know about the court case which may be detrimental to the defendant's business or person. Notice of any case in the newspaper is deemed to be notice to the whole world.
                </br>c. The court may proceed to grant judgment in default of appearance in Court upon satisfaction that substituted service have been effected and the party ought to have notice of pendency of the case against him.
            </br>d. It will cost the party more money, because Court does not wait for anyone who is deemed to have had notice of the case pending against him or her.
        </br>e. There is penal charges for not filing your defence within the time allowed by Rules of Court. In Lagos High Court and Federal High Court default fee per day is =N=1,000 per day. In the National industrial court, it ranges from =N=200 to =N= 500, so is other States of the country.
    </br>f. Depending on the nature of case and under the rules the judgement is given in your absence, you may not be able to have the judgment set aside by the Court, except you appeal to the Higher Court to have the judgment set aside.
</br>g. It is very possible for the judgment not to be set aside, where there is proof of service and the claimant's lawyer did every thing to ensure there is no technical error. The rules of fair hearing will not even avail you because the principle of fair hearing is to give parties opportunity to be heard , hence where such opportunity is not taken by ignoring the court document served, the defendant would have himself or herself to be blamed. 

                    </p>
                <h6>CONCLUSION</h6>
                <p>In conclusion, in order to safe yourself of unnecessary cost, stress and embarrassment, do not ignore the Court processes served on you. Talk to your lawyers, show the documents to your lawyers and they would advice you on the proper step to take.</p>
