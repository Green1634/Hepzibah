                    <h6><b>Introduction</b></h6>    
                    <p>Recently news broke on social media of a 45 year old #Tunde Thomas who died of heart break after finding out his two kids from his marriage were fathered by current MD of FCMB, Adam Nuru. (source: mkmail.ng visited on 5th January, 2020). Thereafter, several other news of husband committing suicide and women having psychological challenges because of the revelation through #DNATest that the husband is not the father of the children of the marriage.</p>
                    <p>“The institution of marriage is sacred and is guarded by laws, cultures, customs, religions and social standards. It is pleasing to every man to know the extent of his progeny beyond doubts, as this gives an inimitable satisfaction.” But it is much easier for women to ascertain their offspring and their number, than it is for men. Marriage in this sense includes marriage under the Marriage Act (statutory marriage), under customary law and under Moslem/Islamic law. (SO Tonwe and OK Edu, Customary Law in Nigeria (Renaissance Law Publishers Limited, 2007) 173 cited in International Journal of Business & Law Research 7(2):112-119, April-June, 2019, © SEAHI PUBLICATIONS, 2019 www.seahipaj.org ISSN: 2360-8986)</p>
                    <p>Adultery either by the man or woman in a marital relationship is reprehensible and same constitutes a ground for divorce. The innocent party is even entitled to claim damages against the adulterous party where such adultery has not been condoned and was committed within a period not exceeding three years. (See Section 31 of the Matrimonial Causes Act).  However, where there are children in the course of the marriage, should their paternity be an issue for determination before the Court? This write up will briefly state the position of Nigerian court on the issue of paternity particularly of the children born during the existence of a marriage.  </p>

                    <h6><b>IMPORTANCE OF PATERNITY:</b></h6>
                    <p>Paternity of a child is as important as life itself if not more. This is because it affects the life span, status and style of the child in question. It makes the child in the eyes of the public either great, respectable and honourable or as the case may be, low and disgraceful. The yoke of illegitimacy continues to haunt him. He suffers psychological debasement in the society for no fault of his. Paternity is an inalienable right of the child as every child must have a father, and one father only. (Rabiu v. Amadu  (2003] 5 NWLR)</p>
                    <h6><b>HOW ISSUE OF PATERNITY OF A CHILD IS RESOLVED:</b></h6>
                    <p>Issue of paternity is usually resolved by one of three methods: viz (i) Genetic engineering (DNA) (ii) facial resemblance and (iii) proof of access for coitus or copulation between the parties. Paternity of a child comes into existence under Islamic law through: (a) Marriage; (b) Acknowledgement; and(c) Evidence.</p>
                    <p>However, the prevalent and most reliable method of ascertaining paternity is DNA. </p>

                    <h6><b>WHAT IS DNA:</b></h6>
                    <p>DNA, that is, "Deoxyribonucleic acid" is a molecule that contains the genetic code of any organism. It is hereditary and has become a euphemism for scientific analysis of genetic constitution, to determine one's roots.</p>
                    <p>DNA test has to do with the use of genetic analysis to determine the paternity of a child. It answers the question of whose male spermatozoa fertilized the egg of a female and is usually applicable and relevant where there is dispute as to the paternity of a child, where there are divergent claims or uncertainty as to the paternity of an individual.(See the case of Olayinka v. Adeparusi & Anor (2011)LPELR 8691)</p>

                    <h6><b>WHEN WILL TRIAL COURT ORDER MEDICAL TEST TO DETERMINE PATERNITY OF A CHILD –</b></h6>
                    <p>The court can order medical test to determine paternity of a child in a divorce matter only where the proceeding is for a decree of nullity of a voidable or a void marriage. Where the relief sought is for dissolution of marriage on grounds other than nullity of a voidable or void marriage, it is improper to order a medical test to determine the paternity of the child(ren) of the marriage. </p>
                    <p>Where a person is a minor (not mature adult) and paternity is in issue, the court can order the conduct of DNA test in the overall interest of the child to ascertain where he belongs. The Court cannot order a mature adult to submit to a DNA test against their wish as same will constitute violation of right to privacy. </p>

                    <h6><b>POSITION OF THE LAW ON CHILDREN BORN DURING THE CONTINUANCE OF A MARRIAGE:</b></h6>
                    <p>There is a presumption of law that a child born during the continuance of a valid marriage between its mother and any man or within 280 days after dissolution of the marriage, the mother remaining unmarried, is the legitimate child of that man. (Section 265, Evidence Act, 2011)</p>
                    <p>The provisions of Section 84 of the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1990; Order XI rules 21(1) and 23 of the Matrimonial Causes Rules; and Section 165 of The Evidence Act, 2011 all point to the fact that on ground of public policy, it is most undesirable to enquire into the paternity of a child whose parents have access to each other. Hence, medical examination of any child born during existence of a valid marriage is uncalled for as such a requirement degrade the sanctity of marriage and is contrary to public policy.  (ODUCHE V. ODUCHE (2006] 5 NWLR  (Part 972) pg 102)</p>
    
                    <p id="indent">In the cited case of Oduche, the couple married in 1984, had two children and the wife had another child 6 months after leaving the husband. The man claimed custody of the 3 children and the wife refused, changed their surname on the argument that, the three children doesnot belong to her husband and alledged that the husband is impotent. The man insisted that the children are his and did not submit to any medical examination, and the court held that the presumption of legitimacy in his favor and even granted him custody of the 1st child. In delivering the Judgement Per RHODES-VIVOUR, J.C.A. at page 125, paras. G-H held that:</p>
                    <p id="indent2"> "Where the husband and wife have co-habited together and no impotency is proved to the satisfaction of the court, the child or children are conclusively presumed to be legitimate even though the wife is shown to have been, at the same time guilty of infidelity, and even where the parents are living apart a very strong presumption of legitimacy still arises, and it can only be rebutted by irresistible proof of non- access to sex."
                    </p>
                    <p>This is the same position under customary law as well as Islamic law. `in the case of RABIU V. AMADU (2003)5 NWLR (PART 813), where the father denied paternity of a child born 8 months after the wedding, the Court held that: “Under no circumstance shall pregnancy or child of the marriage be denied except where the wife delivers a complete baby within a period lesser than 6 months 5 or 6 days less, from the date of the marriage contract.”  Under the Sharia, a child conceived in lawful and valid wedlock is a legitimate child of a man so lawfully and validly married to its mother. This is because under the Sharia, the legitimacy of a child is proved by the proof of the existence of a lawful and valid marriage between the parents at the time of the child's conception. Thus where there is a valid marriage in accordance with the Islamic law dictates, the child can never be made illegitimate.” </p>
                    <p>Per MOHAMMED, J.C.A. at page 372, paras. D-G further held that:</p>
                    <p id="indent">"There is no doubt that the natural outcome of any marriage is procreation and such children cement the relationship between the married partners. It is marriage that also brings about legitimate children. This is the reason why Islam prohibits ZINA or fornication and marriage is made a strong SUNNAH. The children born during the existence of a valid marriage bear the name of the father as the Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) states: 'The child belongs to one on whose bed it is born."   </p>
                    <p>This principle of legitimately was reiterated in the recent case of Idahosav.Idahosa
                        [2020]6NWLR (PART 1720) wherein Honorable Okoro,J.S.C in supporting the lead judgment of Peter-Odili,J.S.C.) that the law is trite that any person born during the continuance of a valid marriage shall be presumed to be a child of that man. The burden of proving otherwise rests with the party alleging the contrary. See Ukeje v. Ukeje (2014) 11 NWLR (Pt. 1418) 384. It is instructive to note that under our law, evidence to dislodge paternity as in the instant case requires prove beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

                    <h6><b>IS THE PRESUMPTION OF LEGITIMACY REBUTTABLE?</b></h6>
                    <p>The principle underlying the rule of legitimacy is obvious. It is most undesirable to enquire into paternity of a child where parents have access to each other. Hence, where there is dispute about the paternity of a child born during wedlock, the presumption is that the husband is the father of that child.  However, that presumption of legitimacy as contained in section 165 of the Evidence Act is rebuttable(See MEGWALU VS MEGWALU (1994) 7 NWLR (PT. 359)718, ODUCHE V. ODUCHE. </p>
                    <p>The presumption of legitimacy under section 165 of the Evidence Act may be displaced:
                        i.by showing that the parties to the marriage had no access to each other. Evidence must be strong, that is to say it must be proved that access was impossible on account of illness, impotence and that the husband is physically incapable of having sexual intercourse with his wife or by scientific evidence that the child was in fact fathered biologically by another man. 
                       </p>
                    <p>One of the modern scientific means of determining the paternity of a child is use of DNA test. Section 57 of the child Right Law of Lagos State empowers the Court to order the use of scientific  tests including blood test and DNA where paternity is in issue. However, consent of the parties concerned is required to for the taking of the blood.  Where the parties concerned have not attached the age of sixteen, the consent of the person who has the care and control of the child is to be sought. Where the father or mother refuses to give the requisite consent, it will be presumed that the child is legitimate, in line with Section 84 of the Matrimonial Act to the effect that parties to a marriage cannot be compelled to give evidence that will proof a child illegitimate.</p>

                    <p><b>The evidence required to rebut the presumption of legitimacy of a child under section 165 of the Evidence Act must be strong, clear and conclusive. It must lead to the irresistible conclusion that the child is not the offspring of the husband. </b></p>
                    <p><b>In the case of ADETUTU SEKINAT BALOGUN VS MR AYODEJI FATAI BALOGUN (REPORTED IN (2013) 1 OGSLR)  the husband believing that the first child of the marriage was his, claimed custody of the child and asked for dissolution of his marriage to his wife on ground of adultery.  The adulterer was joined and alleged that even the 1st child is his.  The wife made an application for DNA and the husband and the adulterer consented, consequently, the court ordered for the DNA test which came out to show that the husband is not the father of any of the children.                   </b></p>
                    <p><b>CONCLUSION:</b></p>

                    <p>Conclusively, any child born during the continuance of any valid marriage, be it customary, Islamic or statutory marriage belongs to the father and it is improper to subject such child to DNA test, to preserve the sanctity of the marriage.</p>
                    <p>The law has always acknowledged the right of a woman to say who the father of her child is, and of course, where a child is born within wedlock, the presumption is conclusive, that the child is the seed or product of the marriage. (Anozia VS. Nnani (2015)8 NWLR (PART 1461) 241), except it is proved beyond reasonable doubt that the husband never or is incapable of sleeping with the wife. DNA test is also admissible as conclusive prof of paternity of a child. (STOCKER VS STOCER (1966) 1 WLR. 190.</p>
                    <p>It is very irresponsible for any man or women to indulge in adultery or Zina. The  claim of a woman or her concubine, in court or in the public or social domain that the lawfully married husband is not the father of her children is founded on an obscene and reprehensive immoral foundation.</p>
                    <p>Therefore if a man has been taking care of the children of an adulterer, he should be saved the heart break of telling him, that his children are products of adultery. The children in a lawful marriage should not under any circumstance be subjected to paternity test as same is against public policy and degrades the sanctity of marriage.
                        However, if the husband is not willing to raise the children  who are not his biologically, he may explore DNA but the child or the mother (if the children are under the care of the mother and under the age of 16) must consent to such blood test.
                        </p>
